# IS497FinalProject

This repo was designed to hold the codes in IS 497 final project.

## Requirements:
The dataset is fairly large, thus without much optimization, the program would took around 8 Gigabytes 
of ram on your computer. Preferably use a 16GB or larger ram to run the program. 

## Dataset:
[Taxi Records developed by TLC](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)
<br>
Users should download the January 2019, January 2020, January 2021 dataset before running the 
program. The dataset should be placed in the data folder. I could not save the dataset on GitHub
as the file exceeds the free data storage limit. 

## Dictionary:

Any license regarding research was not indicated either on the website nor in the dictionary. 
If any violation or misuse of the dataset occurs, the repository would be deleted.
